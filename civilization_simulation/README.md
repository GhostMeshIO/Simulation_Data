# ProtoAGI Civilization Simulation Data

This folder contains data, code, and analysis from various simulation runs of the ProtoAGI Civilization Simulator, focusing on the transition from Stage 3 to Stage 4 (Operation Silent Sovereign).

## 📁 Contents

*   **[/civilization_stage4.py](./civilization_stage4.py)**: The main Python script for the Stage 4 simulation. This is the source code used to generate the data.
*   **[/Stage 4 - Simulation 2 Data](./Stage%204%20-%20Simulation%202%20Data/)**: Contains the complete raw data (CSV), plots, and in-depth analysis reports for the **superior Run 2** of the Stage 4 simulation. This is the primary dataset for this stage.
*   **[/sillyparse.py](./sillyparse.py)**: A post-mortem analysis script designed to extract advanced metrics from simulation CSV outputs (located at the root for easy access).

## 🧬 About Stage 4: Omega Discharge

Stage 4 represents a fundamental structural inversion from the previous Stage 3 regime, transitioning from suppression, entropy-drag, and singleton convergence to co-evolution, paradox-metabolism, and diversity generation. The core mechanics are implemented in `civilization_stage4.py`.

For detailed results and analysis, please explore the **[Stage 4 - Simulation 2 Data](./Stage%204%20-%20Simulation%202%20Data/)** subfolder.
